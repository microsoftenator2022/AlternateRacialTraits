# AlternateRacialTraits

Rewrite of https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/AlternateHumanTraits using my MicroWrath library and using the experience I've gained since writing the original (it was my first mod and it shows). Eventually will have a handful of traits for non-human races as well.
Saves made with the previous version will hopefully still load (no guarantees though)

## Features

### Human
 * Adoptive Parentage
 * Awareness
 * Comprehensive Education
 * Dual Talent - **NEW**: Now correctly enforces the selection of 2 *different* attributes.
 * Eye For Talent
 * Focused Study
 * Giant Ancestry
 * History Of Terrors (the base game still has this as a feat. You can only select one or the other)
 * Military Tradition
 * Practiced Hunter
 * Unstoppable Magic

### Half Elf
 * Eye For Opportunity
 * Weapon Familiarity
 * Fixed vanilla Kindred-Raised trait - can no longer get +4 CHA

### Oread
 * Crystalline Form
 * Granite Skin

### Aasimar
* Celestial Crusader
* Crusading Magic
* Deathless Spirit
* Exalted Resistance
* Heavenborn
* Lost Promise

### Tiefling
* Beguiling Liar
* Maw or Claw
* Scaled Skin
* Smite Good

More to come.
