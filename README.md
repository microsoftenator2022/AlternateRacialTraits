# AlternateRacialTraits

Rewrite of https://github.com/microsoftenator2022/AlternateHumanTraits using my MicroWrath library and using the experience I've gained since writing the original (it was my first mod and it shows). Eventually will have a handful of traits for non-human races as well.
Saves made with the previous version will hopefully still load (no guarantees though)

## Features

### Human
 * Adoptive Parentage
 * Awareness
 * Comprehensive Education
 * Dual Talent - **NEW**: Now correctly enforces the selection of 2 *different* attributes.
 * Focused Study
 * Giant Ancestry
 * History Of Terrors (the base game still has this as a feat. You can only select one or the other)
 * Military Tradition
 * Practiced Hunter
 * Unstoppable Magic

### Half Elf
 * Eye For Opportunity
 * Weapon Familiarity

### Oread
 * Crystalline Form
 * Granite Skin

## Planned/In development

### Oread
 * Stone in the Blood

More to come.

## Install Instructions
 1. Download the mod from the releases page
 2. Using [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager) - on the mods tab, drag the zip onto the window
